\title{Filter sources by stability criteria}
\usage{
filter_stable_sources(features, cv_threshold = 0.6, min_total = 0L)
}
\arguments{
\item{features}{A tibble as returned by \code{\link[=compute_source_features]{compute_source_features()}}.
Must contain columns \code{fonte}, \code{cv} and \code{sum}.}

\item{cv_threshold}{Numeric maximum coefficient of variation
(default 0.6).}

\item{min_total}{Integer minimum total announcement count across
all months (default 0, i.e. no minimum).}
}
\value{
A character vector of stable source names.
}
\description{
Select data sources whose coefficient of variation is at most
\code{cv_threshold} and whose total announcement count is at least
\code{min_total}. Rows with missing values are excluded.
