\title{Plot a skill co-occurrence network graph}
\usage{
plot_cooc_graph(cooc_data, profession = NULL, layout = "fr")
}
\arguments{
\item{cooc_data}{A \code{data.table} (or data.frame) with columns \code{from}, \code{to},
and \code{weight} representing pairwise skill co-occurrences.}

\item{profession}{Optional character string. When supplied, the graph is
drawn with this profession name as plot title.}

\item{layout}{Character, graph layout algorithm passed to
\code{\link[ggraph:ggraph]{ggraph::ggraph()}}. Default \code{"fr"} (Fruchterman-Reingold).}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object produced by \code{ggraph}.
}
\description{
Builds an undirected graph from co-occurrence edge data and renders it with
\code{ggraph}. Edge width and transparency scale with co-occurrence weight.
Nodes are labelled with repelled text to avoid overlap.
}
\details{
Only the largest connected component is plotted, so isolated nodes or
disconnected sub-graphs are dropped.
