\title{Compute skill diffusion using TF-IDF on aggregated skill frequencies}
\usage{
compute_skill_diffusion(skills_by_profession, quantile_trim = 0.025)
}
\arguments{
\item{skills_by_profession}{A \code{data.table} with columns \code{escoskill_level_3}
and \code{N} (occurrence count), typically obtained by aggregating skills merged
with announcements. Each row is a skill-profession pair with its count.}

\item{quantile_trim}{Numeric, quantile threshold for classifying diffusion.
Skills with IDF <= quantile(quantile_trim) are "alta" (highly diffuse),
skills with IDF >= quantile(1 - quantile_trim) are "minima" (rare).
Default: 0.025.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} with columns: \code{escoskill_level_3}, \code{N}, \code{tf}, \code{idf},
\code{diffusione}.
}
\description{
Calculates Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) for each
skill based on aggregated occurrence counts. Skills with very low IDF are
widespread ("alta" diffusion); skills with very high IDF are rare ("minima").
}
\details{
The IDF formula is: \eqn{log(N_{total} / N_{skill})} where counts come from
the aggregated profession-skill matrix.
