\title{Detect skill communities from a co-occurrence edge list}
\usage{
detect_skill_communities(cooc, method = "infomap")
}
\arguments{
\item{cooc}{A \code{data.table} with columns \code{from}, \code{to}, and \code{weight}
representing the co-occurrence edge list. Weights must be positive.}

\item{method}{Character, community detection method. One of \code{"infomap"},
\code{"label_prop"}, \code{"walktrap"}, \code{"spinglass"}. Default: \code{"infomap"}.}
}
\value{
A named \code{list} with:
\describe{
\item{graph}{An \code{igraph} graph object built from the edge list.}
\item{communities}{The community detection result object (class
depends on the method used).}
\item{membership}{A named integer vector mapping each vertex to its
community ID.}
}
}
\description{
Builds an igraph graph from a co-occurrence data.table (edge list with
\code{from}, \code{to}, \code{weight} columns) and applies a community detection
algorithm. Supported methods: infomap, label propagation, walktrap,
and spinglass.
