\title{Filter a co-occurrence matrix by relative risk}
\usage{
filter_relative_risk(cooc_matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{cooc_matrix}{A symmetric numeric matrix (dense or sparse) of
co-occurrence counts, as returned by \code{\link[=compute_cooc_matrix]{compute_cooc_matrix()}}.}
}
\value{
A data.table with columns \code{from}, \code{to}, \code{weight} containing
only edges whose observed co-occurrence exceeds the independence
baseline. Edges are sorted by descending \code{weight}.
}
\description{
Given a raw co-occurrence matrix (e.g. from \code{\link[=compute_cooc_matrix]{compute_cooc_matrix()}}),
computes expected frequencies under independence and retains only
edges where observed / expected > 1. The diagonal and upper triangle
are zeroed so each pair appears at most once.
